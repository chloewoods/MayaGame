# MayaGame
 Project for MDL7001

## Alpha Submission
### Proposed game features in place
- Level is created with basic assets to represent player and game objects.
- Player moves based on player input and collides with environment objects
- Food can be collected and Increases score on UI
- Insects move as expected
- Obstacles stun the player

### Features behind schedule
- Player cannot leave level. This was assumed to be complete but game testing after Alpha submission showed that the wall boundaries were not working properly and the player could leave.

### Features ahead of schedule 
- Game over screen implemented

## Beta Submission
### Proposed game features in place
- Player cannot leave level
- Timer counts down and is displayed In UI
- Game over screen implemented
- Speed boost implemented
- Proper assets used
- Particle effects, music, and sound effects included

### Features behind schedule
- Animations. I have decided to implement this in the final submission instead as we will be learning more about how to implement animations from the 3D in Games module. Therefore I have changed the schedule and added two other features ahead of time.

### Features ahead of schedule
- Finalse placement of objects in 2 levels
- Implement two player functionality
- Main menu can be used to select levels or two player option

- ## Final Submission
### Proposed game features in place
- Animations on player character and insects
- The high score is shown at the end of the end of the level and high scores can be accessed in the menu.

### Feature Alterations/Removals
- The scoring system works differently now. The aim is now to get all the fruit as fast as you can. The UI displays how much fruit is left and the clock counts upwards. The game captures the fastest times to complete levels.
- A third level was not implemented

### Additional features
- Player can pause using esc key
